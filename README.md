# HomeSocketWebServer

This is my pet project in which I created a web server in Python and JavaScript to remotely control ESP boards via a web page. The Esp32 and the frontend connect to the server via WebSocket. One board turns on or off an LED depending on which button is pressed on the page, and the other board uses a temperature and humidity sensor to collect data and send it to the server.
